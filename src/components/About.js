        <p>I’m a Customer Experience aficionado turned Full Stack Web Developer. My experience stems from working with clients to solve their issues to now helping create the interfaces in a way that the end user faces the least amount of issues possible. My unique skill set gives me the ability to fully understand the user experience as I build my code.</p>
        <p>My development experience is rooted in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Node.js, SQL, React and Python. In September 2018 I began my journey through the Columbia University Coding Bootcamp. This is where I honed my skills as a web developer and fell in love with all aspects of development. I’m a people manager with experience in recruiting, training, managing and mentoring both large and small teams.</p>
        <p>My goal is together my skills in customer experience and web development and help to create the ideal experience for all end users. </p>
        <p>In my free time I love to play video games, write, rap, and record music.</p>
